```

## Use of this document

This is an R Markdown document to carry out basic functional analysis on proteomics and phopshporotepomics data. We use basic functional enrichment tools. This type of analysis requires distinct knowledge of the samples at hand so is difficult to generalize.

```{r libraries}
library(leapr)
source("../util/synapseUtil.R")


```

## Get test dataset

For any analysis we need to first collect the data of interest.


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Compute differentially expressed proteins



## Compute differentially expressed phosphosites
