# The PNNL Proteomics Pipeline: P3
This project provides the basic analysis and tools for carrying out end-to-end proteomic analysis for data generated at PNNL. This repository will serve as a resource upon which we can build additional tools in a reusable fashion. 

## Pipeline overview
This pipeline links together a series of data and code repositories to ensure that any data is saved for future use. Furthermore we hope to be able to reproduce the analysis for future projects. A brief overview of each tool is described here.

### PNNL DMS
### Github
### Synapse
### Proteomic Data Commons
