# The PNNL Proteomics Pipeline: P3
This project provides the basic analysis and tools for carrying out end-to-end proteomic analysis for data generated at PNNL. This repository will serve as a resource upon which we can build additional tools in a reusable fashion.

## Pipeline overview
This pipeline links together a series of data and code repositories to ensure that any data is saved for future use. Furthermore we hope to be able to reproduce the analysis for future projects. A brief overview of each tool is described here.

### PNNL DMS
Not sure what to say here.
### Github
Github is used to store all analysis code as well as documentation describing the analysis. Using this repository as a model, make sure to keep all code up to date. To create additional code, see the [./CONTRIBUTING.md] file to add to this repository. You must have your own GitHub account.

### Synapse
All biological data should be stored on [Synapse](http://synapse.org). Synapse operates in private workspaces, called projects. To _create_ a project, you must get a [Synapse id](http://synapse.org/register) and become a [certified user](). Then you can create a new project to store the data. To _add to an existing project_ you must also get a [Synapse id]() and become a [certified user]() but then request access.

### Proteomic Data Commons
Not sure what this will entail.

## Getting started
